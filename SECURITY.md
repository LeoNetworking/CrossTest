# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Here at LeoNetworking we try to integrate as much security as possible. We'll be updating this file regularly to inform you about the latest security updates.
First versions won't have advanced security features as they are mainly to demonstrate the core concept of an idea.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a vulnerability in our security system, please privately inform us about it. If there's no other way an Issue with the label "security flaw" (EXTREME RISK) and we'll get right on it / respond as soon as we hop online.
