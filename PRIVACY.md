# What is Privacy policy?
A Privacy Policy is a legal document that informs users about how their personal information is collected, used, and protected by a website or application. It typically describes what data is collected, how it is stored, who has access to it, and how it is used. To write a simple Privacy Policy, you should include information about the types of data collected (e.g., email addresses), the purpose of data collection (e.g., for newsletter subscriptions), and how the data is protected (e.g., encryption or secure servers).
