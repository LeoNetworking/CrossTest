# Privacy policy
Here at LeoNetworking, we attempt to minimalize user data storage / collection on CrossTest.

Important to note:
- We do not guarantee the safety of your data as we are not 100% skilled developers.
- **Do not enter any personal information as it might be poorly or not protected from public viewing**
- We should not request anything other than an *username* and a *password* for OUR OWN site.
- We do not request your email or password to any thirdparty clients and we do not share your details to any thirdparty clients.
- If we request any personal information, it's either a mistake or a scam. Please create an Issue on GitHub and we'll get right on it!

# What is Privacy policy?
A Privacy Policy is a legal document that informs users about how their personal information is collected, used, and protected by a website or application. It typically describes what data is collected, how it is stored, who has access to it, and how it is used. To write a simple Privacy Policy, you should include information about the types of data collected (e.g., email addresses), the purpose of data collection (e.g., for newsletter subscriptions), and how the data is protected (e.g., encryption or secure servers).
